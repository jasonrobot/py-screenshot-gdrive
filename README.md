# shoot-up-python
Take screenshots and upload them to Google Drive. In Python!

Dependencies:
scrot
xclip

Installing:
A .deb and an AUR package are in the works, but until then, you can always do
one of three things:

1. Download shoot_up_python-0.1.tar.gz and
   1. do `pip install shoot_up_python.tar.gz`
   2. extract the tarball and do `python setup.py install`
2. Clone the whole repo and do `python setup.py install`



This whole thing is really just a fun project for me to sharpen my python skills
and to play around with making distributable code.

It started as an idea for a tool that I could use at work, so we could have
a super quick way of sharing screenshots that was secure, since you can
share entire folders in Google Drive with your organization.

I realize this could be helpful to other people too, which is why I put it up on
github. I'm absolutely open to and code contributions, especially for windows
compatibility, since I don't have windows.

If there's anything you'd like to see, put up an issue and I'll see what I can
do. I know its not perfect as it is right now, and I plan to keep making little
improvments here and there.
